*Here is a python script that reads IQ recordings of radio stations (I think in the UK, 
but this is proof of concept only) and plot the spectrum. I haven’t asked but I suppose

something is not clear. You will need to have numpy, wave and matplotlib installed. The link to 
download the wav file with the recording is provided in the start of the script, check the 
name of the file I was using. Also there is a section of the script that generates a 
similar signal with tones, outputs spectrums of the script are like this:*
