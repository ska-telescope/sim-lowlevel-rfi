This contains the original and an adapted version of code provided by Federico Di Vruno (F.DiVruno@skatelescope.org) to determine the propagation attenuation of RFI for the SKA.

The adapted version calculates the propagation of emission from an example DTV transmitter in Perth to the SKA-Low stations.

The propagation calculations are those described in ITU-R P.452-16 and ITU-R P.676-10 and provided in the python module pycraf (https://bwinkel.github.io/pycraf/index.html).
